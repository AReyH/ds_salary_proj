40,Senior Software Engineer,$88K - $177K (Glassdoor est.),"ABOUT THE JOB
Contracts are the most important document in global commerce. They are also universally a pain. They slow down commerce. People cannot afford to send them to attorneys, because they are too expensive and too slow for the average transaction. Attorneys cannot afford to review them faster or cheaper because they have not had the technology that allows them to deliver contract reviews at scale. Moreover, once contracts are signed, the world cannot keep track of them. It buys databases, and then struggles to keep them organized. Everyone builds a library, but the books are in a mess on the floor.
LegalSifter is growing quickly, and we need someone to join or team as a senior software engineer on our software engineering team, working collaboratively with our Data Science team. We have a team of top-notch software engineers.
